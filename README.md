# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the survival rate of passengers aboard the Titanic using Machine Learning models. Two models were trained and tested:
1.Logistic Regression Model
2.Naive Bayes Classifier Model
Both models achieved an accuracy of 78.19%.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the Titanic dataset, clean and preprocess the data, and build machine learning models to predict whether a passenger survived the disaster based on their features.

# Steps Involved

**1. Data Summarization** 

Analyzed the dataset to understand the structure and distribution of data.
Summarized key statistics and identified missing values.

**2. Data Cleaning**

Handled missing values by imputing or dropping rows/columns where necessary.
Converted categorical variables into numerical representations using encoding techniques.
Scaled numerical features to improve model performance.

**3. Model Training**

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80-20 split).
Trained two machine learning models:
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes Classifier

**4. Model Testing**

Tested the models on the test set and compared their performance.
Measured model accuracy and analyzed classification reports for each model.

# Results

Both models achieved an accuracy of 78.19% on the test set. Detailed performance metrics are included in the classification reports generated during the testing phase.

# Requirements

The project was implemented using Python and the following libraries:
**pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis

**numpy:** Numerical computations

**scikit-learn:** Machine learning models and evaluation metrics

**matplotlib / seaborn:** Data visualization
